### Customer Problem Statement Template:

In a small project management team consisting of a Project Manager (Alice) and a Team Member (Bob), there is a need to efficiently manage project tasks and ensure accountability throughout the project lifecycle. The current system lacks clear role definitions, access controls, and a structured workflow, leading to confusion regarding task assignments and progress tracking.
A better-defined access control and workflow system will help ensure proper task ownership, improved collaboration, and enhanced project transparency.

### Example:

I am
(Customer) I’m trying to But Because Which makes me feel
PS-1 A Project
Manager Manage team
roles there are no structured access controls frustrated and unable to ensure accountability
PS-2 A Team
Member Access assigned tasks clearly the system lacks proper workflow tracking confused about task progress

Problem Statement PS 1:
As a Project Manager, I am trying to manage team roles and assign specific access levels based on responsibilities, but the current system does not provide structured access control or workflow management.
This lack of clarity makes it difficult to maintain accountability and ensure smooth project progress.
I need a solution that enables role-based access, automated workflows, and transparent task management.

Problem Statement PS 2:
As a Team Member, I want to clearly view and update my assigned tasks, but the current system lacks an organized workflow and tracking mechanism.
This causes confusion and miscommunication about task ownership and status. A solution that enables role-based permissions and structured task tracking would help ensure transparency and efficiency.
